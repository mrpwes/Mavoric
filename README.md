## Information
Mavoric is a plugin designed to enforce the generic functions of MC:BE. Mavoric is designed to execute and enforce 
general cheat detection powerfully without a hassle. <br /><br />
Mavoric is feature rich, with TPS checks, cheat checks, banwaves, autobans and autokicks to help you stop cheaters, with the addition of v2.x.x these are much easier to configure.<br />
**Note:** Mavoric was originally intended to be light weight, but in an effort for better cheat detection, we have dropped this goal.
However not all is lost, we plan on adding light weight things in the future.
<br /><br />
Mavoric currently features detections for:
 - AutoArmor
 - AirJump
 - AutoClicker
 - Macros
 - Flight
 - Multiaura
 - Speed
 - ClickTP
 - JetPack
 - HighJump
 - PacketOrder (bad packet sequence)
 - Nuker
 - NoClip
 - No Swing
 - Aim bot
 - Velocity

## History
Early stages of Mavoric were originally developed for the [OwnagePE](shop.ownagepe.com) network, 
after multiple failed attempts at making something functional, Mavoric was then taken into private development 
for improvements and shortly after made an appearance on [Versai](versai.pro) in August 2019 where it has been 
used on a mass scale to help improve it's overall functionality. Mavoric is also planned to be used on [RaptorsMC](discord.raptorsmc.com)
which is a upcoming minigame server with unique minigames.
