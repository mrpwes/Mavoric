# NOTICE
This version of mavoric is no longer being maintained. This was my first attempt at an anticheat, which was actually started when I first started developing. I understand this version is poor in design which is why im working on [v2.0.0 which you can find here.](https://github.com/Olybear9/Mavoric/tree/v2.0.0). Sorry for the inconvienence in the meantime  :(

## Description
Mavoric is a plugin designed to enforce the generic functions of MC:BE. Mavoric is designed to execute and enforce 
general cheat detection powerfully without a hassle. <br />
**Note:** Mavoric is intended to be lightweight in terms of a fully functional anticheat. 

## Developers
If you use any code present here, please have the code reference this repository.

## Information
Mavoric is feature rich, with TPS checks, cheat checks, banwaves, autobans and autokicks to help you stop cheaters. <br />
Mavoric currently features detections for:
 - AutoClicker
 - Flight
 - Multiaura
 - Speed
 - ClickTP
 - JetPack
 - HighJump

 Disclaimer: Mavoric is still currently in development and I can not ensure that you will recieve a 100% bug free experience.

## History
Early stages of Mavoric  were originally developed for the [OwnagePE](shop.ownagepe.com) network, 
after multiple failed attempts at making something functional, Mavoric was then taken into private development 
for improvements and shortly after made an appearance on [Versai](versai.pro) in August 2019 where it has been 
used on a mass scale to help improve it's overall functionality.
